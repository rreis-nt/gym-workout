  - Override text colors to #FFFFFF
  - Change button backgrounds to #D70000 with white text
  - Set card backgrounds to #1C1C1C with white box-shadows
  - Remove all gradient classes and replace with solid colors
  - Ensure minimalist styling with sans-serif font (e.g., Inter)
  - Update day buttons, progress bars, checkboxes, etc., per specifications
- [x] Update index.html for class replacements:
  - Replace bg-gradient-to-br and similar gradient classes with custom high-contrast classes
  - Adjust header, buttons, and other elements to use new theme
- [x] Test the interface by launching in browser to verify contrast and functionality
